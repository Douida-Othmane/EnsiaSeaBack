## Introduction

**EnsiaSea** is a project built (or still in the buidling phase) by second year Software Engineering students from __ENSIAS__. As you can see from its name, it has combined the two words _ENSIAS_ and _SEA_, this combination was based on the website **OpenSea**, and if you can't guess yet, the goal of this project is to build a blockchain website for ENSIAS students to sell, buy, and exchange **NTF**s (**N**on **F**ungible **T**okens). To make this project come true, it was devided into 3 parts: The blockchain network, the back-end, and the front-end of the website. This repository is the main one, and it contains the **BackEnd** part of the project.
